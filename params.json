This website describes the goal of PRIMsrc and why/how you can use it. It also provides some general remarks and links about the software. \r\n\r\n***\r\n### _Idea_\r\n\r\nPRIMsrc is a generic method to perform a Bump Hunting search in high-dimensional data. The method generates decision rules delineating a region in the multi-dimensional predictor space, where a target function of interest assumes larger (or smaller) values than its average over the entire space.\r\n\r\nThe picture below illustrates the idea. The sunshine over the mountain range shows how light can uncover peaks, highlands and valleys, just like we want to do for data structures such as local/global extrema by using a PRIMsrc-based Bump Hunting approach.\r\n\r\n![Mountains](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedazard/PRIMsrc/gh-pages/Mountains.jpg)\r\n([Bill Wight Photography] (https://www.flickr.com/photos/wwwca/), Copyright 2015, with permission)\r\n\r\n***\r\n### _Formal_ _Goal_ - _Description_\r\n\r\nConsider a supervised setting, where the target function of interest is a response vector of a multivariate vector of input explanatory variables.\r\n\r\nDenote by R^{_p_} a _p_-dimensional Euclidean space and _f_(**x**) the unknown target function of interest of input explanatory variables **x**=(**x**\\_{1}, **x**\\_{2}, … , **x**\\_{p}) of support _S_ \\subseteq R^{_p_}.\r\n\r\nThe goal is three fold :\r\n\r\n* Characterize a sub-region _R_ \\subseteq _S_ in the input space over which the target function _f_(**x**) is expected to have a local and/or global maximum (minimum). This is broader than finding the modal (anti-modal) regions, because _f_(**x**) can be e.g. a regression function, that is, not necessarily a probability distribution function. The region _R_ could be any smooth shape (e.g. a convex hull), possibly disjointed\r\n* Determine which of the input variables (**x**\\_{1}, **x**\\_{2}, … , **x**\\_{p}) are important/relevant in the process\r\n* Identify corresponding sub-groups of samples within region _R_\r\n\r\nWe chose to achieve these goals simultaneously by using a non-parametric Bump Hunting approach. PRIMsrc implements a unified treatment of Bump Hunting in Survival, Regression and Classification settings (SRC) using an algorithm derived from the Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM), initially introduced by Fisher & Friedman in 1999 [(See publications list on the Wiki page)] (https://github.com/jedazard/PRIMsrc/wiki/4\\)-Publications). PRIMsrc estimates the target region _R_ of interest by generating decision rules delineating a region in the multi-dimensional predictor space where the response is larger (or smaller) than its average over the entire space. In PRIMsrc, the approximation of the region _R_ is shaped as a hyper-dimensional box or hyper-rectangle, parallel to the coordinate axes and possibly disjointed.\r\n\r\n***\r\n### _Assumptions_\r\n\r\nAssumptions are that the multivariate inputs are assumed to be real-valued, discrete or continuous variables, and the response variable is assumed to be a real-valued, bounded, univariate variable that can be discrete (Classification), continuous (Regression) or a censored time-to event (Survival). It is intended to handle low and high-dimensional multivariate datasets, including the situation where the number of covariates _p_ exceeds or dominates the number _n_ of samples (_p_ > _n_ or _p_ >> _n_ paradigm).\r\n\r\n***\r\n### _Why Use PRIMsrc?_\r\n\r\nThe problem of \"Bump Hunting\" covers mathematical / statistical tasks such as:\r\n* Mode(s) Hunting\r\n* Local/Global Extremum(a) Finding\r\n* Subgroup(s) Identification\r\n* Outlier(s) Detection\r\n* …\r\n\r\nDirect applications are multiple, such as:\r\n* characterization and stratification of patient groups with respect to diagnostic and/or prognostic purposes with benefits in personalized and economical medicine\r\n* system reliability analysis in engineering  \r\n* duration analysis/modeling in economics\r\n* event history analysis in sociology\r\n* financial securities return\r\n* insurance risk assessment\r\n* …\r\n\r\n***\r\n### _Readme_\r\nVisit the Project [Readme](https://github.com/jedazard/PRIMsrc/blob/master/README.md) webpage to learn about _License_, _Downloads_, _Branches_, _Requirements_, _Installation_ and _Usage_\r\n\r\n***\r\n### _Wiki_\r\n\r\nVisit the Project [Wiki](https://github.com/jedazard/PRIMsrc/wiki) webpage for _Roadmap_, _Documentation_ and _Examples_, _Publications_, _Case Studies_, _Support_ and _How to Contribute_ (code and documentation).\r\n\r\n***\r\n<!-- Start of SimpleHitCounter Code -->\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.simplehitcounter.com\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://simplehitcounter.com/hit.php?uid=2026113&f=65280&b=0\" border=\"0\" height=\"18\" width=\"83\" alt=\"web counter\"></a><br><a href=\"http://www.simplehitcounter.com\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">web counter</a></div>\r\n<!-- End of SimpleHitCounter Code -->","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
