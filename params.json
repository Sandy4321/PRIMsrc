{"name":"PRIMsrc","tagline":"Bump Hunting by Patient Rule Induction Method for Survival, Regression and Classification","body":"PRIMsrc performs a unified treatment of Bump Hunting by Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM) in Survival, Regression and Classification settings (SRC). The method generates decision rules delineating a region in the predictor space, where the response is larger than its average over the entire space. The region is shaped as a hyperdimensional box or hyperrectangle, possibly disjointed. \r\n\r\n***\r\n### _Idea_\r\n\r\nThe sunshine over the mountain range illustrates how light can uncover peaks, highlands and valleys, just like we want to do for data structures such as local/global extrema by using a PRIMsrc-based Bump Hunting approach.\r\n\r\n![Mountain_Range](https://github.com/jedazard/PRIMsrc/blob/master/Website/Mountain_Range.jpg)\r\n\r\n([Bill Wight Photography] (https://www.flickr.com/photos/wwwca/), Copyright 2015, with permission)\r\n\r\n***\r\n### _Assumptions_\r\n\r\nAssumptions are that the multivariate input covariates can be discrete or continuous and the univariate response variable can be discrete (Classification), continuous (Regression) or a time-to event, possibly censored (Survival). It is intended to handle low and high-dimensional multivariate datasets, including the situation where the number of variables exceeds or dominates that of samples (_p_ > _n_ or _p_ >> _n_ paradigm). \r\n\r\n***\r\n### _General Remarks_\r\n\r\nCRAN downloads since initial release to CRAN (2015-07-28):\r\n[![](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/PRIMsrc)](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/PRIMsrc/index.html)\r\nas tracked by [RStudio CRAN mirror](http://cran-logs.rstudio.com/)\r\n\r\nCRAN downloads in the last month:\r\n[![](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/last-month/PRIMsrc)](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/PRIMsrc/index.html)\r\n\r\nCRAN downloads in the last week:\r\n[![](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/last-week/PRIMsrc)](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/PRIMsrc/index.html)\r\n\r\n***\r\n### _License_\r\n\r\nPRIMsrc is open source / free software, licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3), \r\nsponsored by the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/).
