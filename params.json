{"name":"PRIMsrc","tagline":"Bump Hunting by Patient Rule Induction Method for Survival, Regression and Classification","body":"### Welcome to the **`PRIMsrc`** project. This website describes the goal of PRIMsrc and why/how you can use it. It also provides some general remarks and links about the software. \r\n\r\n***\r\n### _Idea_\r\n\r\nPRIMsrc is a generic method to perform a Bump Hunting search in high-dimensional data. The method generates decision rules delineating a region in the multi-dimensional predictor space, where a target function of interest assumes larger (or smaller) values than its average over the entire space.\r\n\r\nThe picture below illustrates the idea. The sunshine over the mountain range shows how light can uncover peaks, highlands and valleys, just like we want to do for data structures such as local/global extrema by using a PRIMsrc-based Bump Hunting approach.\r\n\r\n![Mountains](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedazard/PRIMsrc/gh-pages/Mountains.jpg)\r\n([Bill Wight Photography] (https://www.flickr.com/photos/wwwca/), Copyright 2015, with permission)\r\n\r\n***\r\n### _Why Use PRIMsrc?_\r\n\r\nThe problem of \"Bump Hunting\" covers mathematical / statistical tasks such as:\r\n* Mode(s) Hunting\r\n* Local/Global Extremum(a) Finding\r\n* Subgroup(s) Identification\r\n* Outlier(s) Detection\r\n* …\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n* characterization and stratification of samples into new groups\r\n\r\nDirect applications are multiple:\r\n* personalized medicine (improved accuracy of diagnostication and/or prognostication)  \r\n* economical medicine (hot spotting)\r\n* alternative drug/treatment indication (re-purposing)\r\n* system reliability analysis in engineering  \r\n* duration analysis/modeling in economics\r\n* event history analysis in sociology\r\n* financial securities return\r\n* insurance risk assessment\r\n* …\r\n\r\n***\r\n### _Readme_\r\nVisit the Project [Readme](https://github.com/jedazard/PRIMsrc/blob/master/README.md) webpage to learn about _License_, _Downloads_, _Branches_, _Requirements_, _Installation_ and _Usage_\r\n\r\n***\r\n### _Wiki_\r\n\r\nVisit the Project [Wiki](https://github.com/jedazard/PRIMsrc/wiki) webpage for _Roadmap_, _Documentation_ and _Examples_, _Publications_, _Case Studies_, _Support_ and _How to Contribute_ (code and documentation).\r\n\r\n***\r\n<!-- Start of SimpleHitCounter Code -->\r\n<div align=\"center\"><a href=\"http://www.simplehitcounter.com\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://simplehitcounter.com/hit.php?uid=2026113&f=65280&b=0\" border=\"0\" height=\"18\" width=\"83\" alt=\"web counter\"></a><br><a href=\"http://www.simplehitcounter.com\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\">web counter</a></div>\r\n<!-- End of SimpleHitCounter Code -->","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
