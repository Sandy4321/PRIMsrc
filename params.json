At this point, this version is also restricted to a \r\ndirected peeling search of the first box covered by the recursive coverage \r\n(outer) loop of our Patient Recursive Survival Peeling (PRSP) algorithm. New \r\nfeatures will be added soon as they are available. \r\n\r\nThe main function relies on an optional variable pre-selection procedure that is run before the PRSP algorithm. \r\nAt this point, this is done by a cross-validated penalization of the partial likelihood using the R package [`glmnet`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmnet/index.html).\r\n\r\nIn this version, the bump hunting procedure and the cross-validation procedures that control the model size and model peeling length are carried out by two separate procedures within a single main function `sbh()` that generates a unique S3-class object 'PRSP'.  \r\n\r\n- The first branch (devel) hosts a development version of the code (version 0.7.0) that is more rigorous and modular. \r\nHere, a single internal cross-validation procedure is carried out to simultaneously control model size (#covariates) and model complexity (#peeling steps) before the model is fit. \r\nSpecifically, it does a univariate bump hunting variable selection procedure, where model size and model complexity are simultaneously optimized using the cross-validation criterion of choice: \r\nConcordance Error Rate (CER), Log-Rank Test (LRT), or Log-Hazard Ratio (LHR) (see companion paper below for details).\r\n\r\n- The second branch (unified) will host the future complete version of the code (version 1.0.0), including undirected peeling search by Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM) that will allow the unified treatment of bump hunting for every type of common response: Survival, Regression and Classification (SRC).\r\n\r\n\r\n===========\r\n### License\r\n\r\nPRIMsrc is Open Source / Free Software, available under the GNU General Public License, version 3. \r\nSee details [here](https://github.com/jedazard/PRIMsrc/blob/master/LICENSE).\r\n\r\n\r\n================\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n* To install PRIMsrc from CRAN, simply download and install the current version (0.6.3) from the CRAN repository:\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\ninstall.packages(\"PRIMsrc\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Alternatively, you can install the most up-to-date version (0.6.3) from GitHub, using devtools:\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\r\nlibrary(\"devtools\")\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"jedazard/PRIMsrc\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n================\r\n### Requirements\r\n\r\nPRIMsrc 0.6.3 requires R-3.0.2 (2013-09-25). It was built and tested under R-devel (2015-11-04 r69597) and Travis CI. \r\n\r\nInstallation has been tested on Windows, Linux, OSX and Solaris platforms. \r\n\r\nSee Travis CI build result:\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jedazard/PRIMsrc.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jedazard/PRIMsrc)\r\n\r\nSee CRAN checks:\r\n\r\n[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/PRIMsrc)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_PRIMsrc.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n=========\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n* To load the PRIMsrc library in an R session and start using it:\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\nlibrary(\"PRIMsrc\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Check the package news with the R command:\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\nPRIMsrc.news()\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Check on how to cite the package with the R command:\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\ncitation(\"PRIMsrc\")\r\n```\r\n\r\netc...\r\n\r\n\r\n==============\r\n### Wiki\r\n\r\nSee [Wiki](https://github.com/jedazard/PRIMsrc/wiki) page for Roadmap, Publications, Case Studies, Documentation and Manual, Examples and Support.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
