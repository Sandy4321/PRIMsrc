The method generates decision rules delineating a region in the multi-dimensional predictor space, where a target function assumes larger (or smaller) values than its average over the entire space.\r\n\r\nThe picture below illustrates the idea. The sunshine over the mountain range shows how light can uncover peaks, highlands and valleys, just like we want to do for data structures such as local/global extrema by using a PRIMsrc-based Bump Hunting approach.\r\n\r\n![Mountains](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedazard/PRIMsrc/gh-pages/Mountains.jpg)\r\n([Bill Wight Photography] (https://www.flickr.com/photos/wwwca/), Copyright 2015, with permission)\r\n\r\n***\r\n### _Formal_ _Goal_ - _Description_\r\n\r\nConsider a supervised setting, where the target function of interest is a univariate response vector (discrete, continuous or possibly  censored) of a multivariate vector of input explanatory variables (continuous or discrete).\r\n\r\nDenote by R^{_p_} a _p_-dimensional Euclidean space and _f_(**x**) the unknown target function of interest of input explanatory variables **x**=(**x**\\_{1}, **x**\\_{2}, … , **x**\\_{p}) of support _S_ \\subseteq R^{_p_}.\r\n\r\nThe goal is three fold :\r\n\r\n* Characterize a sub-region _R_ \\subseteq _S_ in the input space over which the target function _f_(**x**) is expected to have a local maximum (≠ noise). The region _R_ could be any smooth shape (e.g. a convex hull), possibly disjointed\r\n* Determine which of the input variables (**x**\\_{1}, **x**\\_{2}, … , **x**\\_{p}) are important/relevant in the above task\r\n* Identify corresponding sub-groups of samples within region _R_\r\n\r\nWe chose to achieve these goals simultaneously by using a Bump Hunting approach. PRIMsrc implements a unified treatment of non-parametric Bump Hunting in Survival, Regression and Classification settings (SRC) using an algorithm derived from the Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM), initially introduced by [Fisher & Friedman in 1999](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1008894516817). PRIMsrc estimates the target region _R_ of interest where the response is larger (or smaller) than its average over the entire space. This is done by generating decision rules delineating an approximation of the region _R_, which is shaped in PRIMsrc as a hyper-dimensional box or hyper-rectangle, possibly disjointed.\r\n\r\n***\r\n### _Assumptions_\r\n\r\nAssumptions are that the multivariate input variables can be discrete or continuous and the univariate response variable can be discrete (Classification), continuous (Regression) or a time-to event, possibly censored (Survival). It is intended to handle low and high-dimensional multivariate datasets, including the situation where the number of covariates _p_ exceeds or dominates the number _n_ of samples (_p_ > _n_ or _p_ >> _n_ paradigm).\r\n\r\n***\r\n### _Why Use PRIMsrc?_\r\n\r\nThe problem of \"Bump Hunting\" covers mathematical / statistical tasks such as:\r\n* Mode(s) Hunting\r\n* Local/Global Extremum(a) Finding\r\n* Subgroup(s) Identification\r\n* Outlier(s) Detection\r\n* …\r\n\r\nDirect applications are multiple, such as:\r\n* characterization and stratification of patient groups with respect to diagnostic and/or prognostic purposes with benefits in personalized and economical medicine\r\n* system reliability analysis in engineering  \r\n* duration analysis/modeling in economics\r\n* event history analysis in sociology\r\n* financial securities return\r\n* insurance risk assessment\r\n* …\r\n\r\n***\r\n### _Downloads_\r\n\r\nCRAN downloads since initial release to CRAN (2015-07-28):\r\n[![](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/PRIMsrc)](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/PRIMsrc/index.html)\r\nas tracked by [RStudio CRAN mirror](http://cran-logs.rstudio.com/)\r\n\r\nCRAN downloads in the last month:\r\n[![](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/last-month/PRIMsrc)](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/PRIMsrc/index.html)\r\n\r\nCRAN downloads in the last week:\r\n[![](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/last-week/PRIMsrc)](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/PRIMsrc/index.html)\r\n\r\n***\r\n### _License_\r\n\r\nPRIMsrc is open source / free software, licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3), \r\nsponsored by the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/).
