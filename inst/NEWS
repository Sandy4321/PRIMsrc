o RELEASE 0.4.0
- Extension to high-dimensional p > n and p >> n cases by adding an internal variable selection procedure 
  using the Elasticnet-Regularized Cox Regression function of the 'glmnet' package.
- Removed (temporarily) interactive option in sbh() in case no variables are selected by glmnet(...).
- Added dependency to glmnet package for initial variable selection.
- Added synthetic dataset #5 and example with p > n.
- Added real dataset #2 and example with p >> n.
- Added new ouputs 'selected' and 'used' in main function sbh(...) for variables effectively selected and used for peeling. 
- Removed returned values of box vertices that were redudant with the returned rules.
- Changed return value of variable traces: now also returns the matrix of traces by replication.
- Corrected superfluous codes in the parallelization section, before clusterCall(...) in sbh(...).
- Corrected number of replications in sbh(...) in case of parallelization. 
- Corrected stepwise variable selection procedure in peel.box() to account for missing values.
- Corrected definition of the cross-validated box vertices (definition) in the case of "combined CV" technique.
- Corrected generation of random seed when none is provided. 
- Minor updates, bugs and code improvements in sbh(...) and peel.box(...) functions.
- Updated manual, version number.
- Test build under 3.0.2 and release update to GitHub.

Date   : 2015-03-23
o RELEASE 0.5.5
- Made the internal variable selection procedure conditional on whether p <= n or not.
- Corrected treatment of missing values in case of replications for the variable traces.
- Corrected output of variables used for peeling now based on variable trace modal values.
- Several minor bugs corrected in all plotting functions.
- Test build under 3.0.2 and release update to GitHub.
